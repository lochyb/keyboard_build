CRKBD Corne v3 Build Log / Setup

I wanted to improve my desk ergonomics so I decided to purchase a built it yourself keyboard kit.

For those in Japan you can purcashe the kit from here
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://shop.yushakobo.jp/"> https://shop.yushakobo.jp/</a>
  </ul>

The assembely requires soldering and little but of computer skills to flash the software on the keyboard.

There is an online guide available in both Japanese and English here at

  <p>I added a custom logo to the right side of the keyboard. 
  I used these two articles as a guide to do so.
